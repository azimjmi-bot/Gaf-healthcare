# Velora

Private medical travel atelier with four surfaces: **Doctors**, **Hospitals**, **Treatment Cost**, and **Blogs**. Radiation oncology procedures only.

Doctors and hospitals are stored with denormalized **specialty**, **procedure**, **city**, and **country** slugs (`src/lib/taxonomy.ts`, `src/lib/doctors.ts`, `src/lib/hospitals.ts`) so programmatic SEO routes can be mounted later without rewriting the catalog:

- `/doctors/{country}/{city}/{specialty}/{procedure}`
- `/hospitals/{country}/{city}/{specialty}/{procedure}`

Those paths are not live yet. Directory pages already group by the same keys.

The India radiation-oncology roster (70 consultants, 23 campuses) and structured fields were sourced from [Ginger Healthcare’s public listing](https://ginger.healthcare/destinations/india/radiation-oncology/). Bios on this site are original Velora copy. Portraits wait on CMS.

The consult form posts to `/api/consult` and returns a reference number. There is no database in this slice — submissions are validated and acknowledged so the intake experience can be used end to end.

Cost ranges on treatment pages are illustrative, not quotes. Velora is presented as a coordinator, not a hospital.
